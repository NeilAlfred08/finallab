### About Myself

I currently reside in the charming town of Alfonso, located in the province of Cavite in the Philippines. Nestled amidst picturesque landscapes, Alfonso offers a tranquil and serene environment that I'm fortunate to call home. As for my educational journey, I have recently completed my college studies, marking a significant milestone in my life. The experiences and knowledge I gained during my time at Cavite State University Main Campus and took a bachelor degree in Information Technology have shaped me in profound ways, preparing me for the next chapter of my journey. The memories I've made while living in Alfonso and pursuing my education will always hold a special place in my heart as I step into the future with a sense of accomplishment and anticipation for what lies ahead.
